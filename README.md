¬	Use the Employee class you have created for your assignment 3. Make a class Manager which inherits from Employee. Add an instance attribute department of type String. Supply a method toString that prints the manager’s name, address and department.
¬	Your program should do the following:
o	Create one Company object and display a GUI similar to the one displayed below.
o	When the “Add an Employee” button is pressed, an InputDialog box should appear to allow users enter the name and address of the employee. After that the user should be prompted to specify if the employee is a manager or not. If the employee is a manager, then the user must specify the department name. Then the new employee (or manager) should be added to the company.
o	When the “List Employees” button is pressed, the list of all the employees added to the company must be displayed on a MessageDialogBox. 
  
  
### Date Checking Assignment  
  
Write a program which gets as input a string from a text field, representing a date in the form DD/MM/YY (for instance 03/02/01).
Your program should produce an error message if a date item is non-numeric, is missing completely or specifies an impossible date. Ignore leap years.
Your program should produce a GUI with a label, a text field and a button as shown below. When the Verify Date button is pressed your program should read the date from the text field and verify it.
  
  
### Employee Assignment  
  
¬	Implement a class called Employee. For the purpose of this exercise, an employee has:
o	a name,
o	an employee number,
o	address,
o	salary, and
o	a list of bonuses given to him/her
¬	Supply appropriate constructors and public interfaces for the Employee class. Provide methods like 
o	getName, 
o	getEmployeeNumber, 
o	getAddress, 
o	getSalary, 
o	changeAddress, 
o	changeSalary
o	addBonus. 
¬	Please note that up to 10 bonuses can be given to an employee. A bonus will be given to an employee because of good performance, so an Employee object is created first with no bonus.

¬	Supply an EmployeeTest class that tests all Employee methods. The EmployeeTest program should:
o	Ask the user to provide information for two employees.
o	Create two Employee objects with the information provided by the user. 
o	Add a few bonuses to one employee.

¬	When Circle is selected, let the user draw a circle with two mouse clicks. The first one on the center and the second on a point on the periphery of the circle. 
¬	When Triangle is selected, let the user draw a triangle with three mouse clicks.
